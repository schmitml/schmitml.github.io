## About

Hi there!
Glad to see that you found my website, and I hope that you find some useful information here.

A little about myself. I was born and raised in Chicago, IL until age 9 when I moved to London, UK with my family.
In the UK I attended two international schools and found my passion for computer science, politics, and economics.
I moved back to the US to attend university at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where I am currently majoring in computer science.
Recently I spent my summer as a software engineering intern at Motorola Solutions Inc. working on android development for secure VoIP solutions.
During this upcomming summer, I will be working at Microsoft in the Office Group.

Apart from school, I spend my time working as the Editor-in-Chief for Rose-Hulman's student run newspaper, The Rose Thorn.

Take a look at my <a href="/resume-marc-schmitt.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.
