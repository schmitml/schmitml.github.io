Welcome to my personal website!

I started this website to start documenting side projects that I am working on while at school and work. I will update on the state of each project and issues that I might run into. Currently I am focused on android development, with a focus on wearables. I am planning to shift my focus to web development as I have started to learn about various web technologies, including jekyll, that I find very interesting. However, my next couple of posts will be documenting my experience with the open source SIP stack, PJSIP, which I am using for an android VoIP app.

Stay Tuned!
